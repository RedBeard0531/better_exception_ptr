# better_exception_ptr
A proposal for ISO C++ to inspect and handle `std::exception_ptr` without throwing and catching

A note on licensing: All of *my* code in this repo is Apache2. However this library includes headers
describing the platform ABI that is under its own license. The libstd++/libsupc++ code is under GPL.
The MSCV header is cobbled together from various sources, so I don't know what license it is under.
